# 🧠 learn-tech  
## *Not notes. Not tutorials. A thinking framework for builders.*

> You don’t need more information.  
> You need **structured understanding** — so when the stack evolves, *you evolve with it*.

A living repository of **deep-dive paths**, forged in real projects, debug sessions, and “aha!” moments.  
No fluff. No outdated trends. Just durable fundamentals — ready to be applied *today*.



## 🔥 Where the Rubber Meets the Road

| Path | Status | What You’ll Own After |
|------|--------|------------------------|
| **`/db/sql`** | ✅ **Production-Ready** | *“I know why my query is slow — and how to fix it.”*  
| `/lang/python` | ✅ **Core Solid** | *“I write Python that’s readable, testable, and *fast enough*.”*  
| `/lang/java` | ✅ **JVM-Aware** | *“I understand the heap, not just the syntax.”*  
| `/infra/docker` | ✅ **Works on My Machine™ → Works Everywhere** | *“I containerize without cargo-culting.”* |



## 🗺️ On the Horizon — Validated, Not Hyped

| Path | When? | Why It Matters |
|------|-------|----------------|
| `/db/nosql` | 🔜 After next MongoDB project | *When your data refuses to fit in rows — and you need to know why that’s okay* |
| `/frontend/angular` | 🔜 After building internal tools | *Not just components — how change detection *really* works under pressure* |
| `/infra/cloud` | 🔜 Post-deployment war stories | *You’ll learn IAM not from docs — but from the moment access was *almost* revoked* |
| `/design/systems` | 🔜 When “it works” isn’t enough | *Scalability isn’t theory — it’s what you do at 2 AM when traffic spikes* |

> 📌 Each path ships **only when tested in production** — no speculative content.

## 🤝 Want to Shape What’s Next?

This isn’t a monologue — it’s a **collaborative deep dive**.

We value:
- 🔧 **Precision fixes** (typos, broken links, outdated flags)  
- 💡 **Clearer explanations** (if it clicked for you — help it click for others)  
- 🧪 **Better labs** (small, reproducible, *actually* work on M1/Linux/WSL)  
- 🔗 **Cross-stack insights**  
  > *Example:* _“How Python’s GIL affects PostgreSQL connection pooling”_
